This project has been created to share that how how a basic 3D engine works.
 Please note that by the word basic I mean that this 3D engine will not do any kind of raytracing, animation or anything else.
 It's for developers who are wondering how the 3D engine works and how to show a basic 3D shape with only its coordinates on a 2D screen.
For better explanation of projecting 3d coordinates on 2d space check this answer written by me:- https://stackoverflow.com/a/74890600/20496842

In _3DENGINE folder you will find :-
  A MAIN.java file which contains a paint method where you can create 3D objects/models with the help of coordinates only.
Other file you will find is TDFUN.java which has some functions like perspective projection, matrix multiplication and etc.
You can check the code for more details.
